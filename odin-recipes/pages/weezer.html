    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Weezer is an American band formed in 1992. They are well
        known for their 1994 song "Buddy Holly", which came off 
        their acclaimed debut "Weezer", aka "The Blue Album".
    </p>
    <p>Despite being a fantastic band, the greatness of Weezers 
        songs has declined over the years. Recent albums such as "The Black Album" 
        and "Ok Human" really suck. Their covers album, "The Teal Album", 
        did have some good songs. But ultimately, recent Weezer sucks balls.
