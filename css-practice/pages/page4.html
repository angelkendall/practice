    <h1>CSS PRACTICE - PAGE 4</h1>
    <h3>Block and Inline</h3>
    <p>This page is about <em>block</em> and <em>inline</em> elements</p>

    <p><em>block</em> elements start on a new line, and will stack on top of 
    each other by default.</p>
    <p><em>inline</em> elements don't start on a new line, and appear beside the 
    elements they're placed next to.</p>
    <p class="note">Note: Generally don't want to put padding or margin on inline elements</p>

    <p>Divs and spans are just boxes that can contain anything. Divs are 
        block-level by default. Span is inline-level by default.</p>
    
    <p>The following are some tests:</p>

    <div class="red-box">This box has a margin of 30px, and padding of 
        50px
        <p class="white">If two elements next to each other have a margin set,
            and the two margins touch, the larger of the two remains and the smaller
            margin disappears.
        </p>
        <p class="white">Here, the red boxes margin has taken over the blue's</p>
        
        <p class="white">This sentence is to test out the <span class="first-span">span element,
            which is an inline element that</span> defaults to being inline.
            This is useful to do things <span class="second-span">such as style a particular section</span> 
            of text within a paragraph for example. 
        </span></p>
    
    </div>


    <div class="blue-box">This box has a margin of 20px, and padding of 
        30px
    </div>
    <p>The first three green boxes are set to "display: inline-block",
        and so appear in a line. The last green box has the default "display: block",
        and so appears on a new line.
    </p>
    <div class="green-box"></div>
    <div class="green-box"></div>
    <div class="green-box"></div>
    <div class="green-box block"></div>
    <p> The first three boxes are set to "inline", which shouldn't be done for divs - only spans.
        The second two are set to "inline-block", and are next to each other on the same line as the first three,
        The last two are set to "block", and are on their own lines - not next to each other.
