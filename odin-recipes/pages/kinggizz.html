    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard (K.G.L.W) are a band from Melbourne, Australia. 
        Well known for both releasing many albums in a short amount of time, and for 
        experimenting in all sorts of different genres, King Gizz has cemented themselves
        as one of Australia's greatest bands of all time. Imo
    </p>
    <p>The worst part about King Gizzard are their fans. Going to their concerts
        are equally one of the best and worst things to experience. On one hand,
        it's so cool to see the geniuses perform live. Seeing Lord of Lightning live was 
        the coolest thing. But being among all of the other King Gizz fans is so gross.
        So many disgusting boys and selfish people. How can such a cool band have such rubbish fans?
