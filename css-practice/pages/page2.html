    <h1>CSS PRACTICE - PAGE 2</h1>
    <h3>Css Basics - Colours, Fonts, Alignments</h3>
    <p>This page should have several different elements of CSS within it to practice a bit with classes</p>
    <p class="test-three">This sentence should be red because it's in a paragraph with class "test-three</p>
    
    <div>
        <p>This text is just green, despite being within a div because it's also in a paragraph</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="test-four">
        This text is in a grey box with hotpink text because it's in a div with the class "test-four"
    </div>

    <div class="test-one">
        This text will be white, in a reddish background, because it's in a div with the class "test-one"
    </div>

    <div class="test-two">
        This text should be larger, a different font, brown, on a white background,
        and in the center? And now it should also be bold. It's in a div with the class "test-two"
    </div>

    <img src="../images/duck.jpg">
    This text should be black because it's not within a paragraph or a div.

    <div>
        This text should be a blueish colour because that's the colour of text in a regular div.
    </div>
